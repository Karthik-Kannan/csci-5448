# csci-5448
CSCI 5448 Final Project. Object Oriented Design and Analysis

Plan for the Week (4th Feb to 11th Feb):
1) Decide on if we need a relational database for authentication and a nosql database for storing the data.
2) Implement authenication mechanism using a flask library. A basic HTML page with Login/Sign Up page. A database backend with just one table/collection to store username/password in encrypted form. This would give us a framework to work on.
